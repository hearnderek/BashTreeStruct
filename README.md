# BashTreeStruct
If you had to represent a tree in bash, how would you do it?

At first I was considering having everything stored as a (in memory) file, but I wanted to restrict myself to stay within bash and not lean on the filesystem.

## Think you can do better?
Good!

Please send a pull request and I'll be happy to add your file to the repo.
